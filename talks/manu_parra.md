## Abstract (200 words max.) 

HI (not Hello, not Hi, just Neutral Hydrogen), also known as the Cosmic Hydrogen Cool Kids Club ðŸ˜€, is basically the 'cool' version of hydrogen floating in space. Picture it: it's just like normal hydrogen, but it's not in the mood for wild parties, so it just sits there, emitting this distinctive 21-centimetre wavelength signal as if it were the universal radio streaming station. Radio astronomers love this "HI radio" because it tells them how hydrogen lives in galaxies ;). It's the ultimate party pooper, giving us the scoop on how galaxies mingle, merge and sometimes even throw epic cosmic parties. Not to mention that it's the VIP pass to the dark matter disco, allowing us to dance to the gravitational beat of the universe. In a few words, HI is the celestial DJ that rocks the galactic dance floor and informs us on everything from cosmic makeovers to gravitational dance moves, rotation curves and/or/to galactic structures and evolution.

In this context, HI classification is important as it enables astronomers to discern and categorize the diverse properties and behaviors of neutral hydrogen gas within galaxies, providing crucial insights into galactic structures, interactions, and evolution.
